     <h1>Welcome</h1>
     <p> Hello! My name is Rafaela Diaz and this May 2020 I graduated from The University of Tulsa's Computer Information Systems program at Collins College of Business. Welcome to my repository where you will find the technical training and certifications that I have acquired through my coursework at the University of Tulsa as a CIS undergrad student. Thank you! </p>

     <details><summary>VPN</summary>
        <br>
        I installed the lastest version of Ubuntu server and configured my own IPSEC VPN in the cloud using the <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/algo">Algo VPN</a> Ansible scripts provided by Trail of Bits. With the help of this tutorial, I successfully deployed the Algo server, configured VPN clients, set up an SSH tunnel, and added and removed users. 
        I also had to set up an account with Digital Ocean, a cloud hosting provider, to run the VPN and download the Wireguard app for macOS to enable my VPN clients. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="AlgoVPN.png" alt="Algo VPN photo"> 
        <br>
        <br>
        Using Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 Instances, I configured Algo VPN using the <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/algo/blob/master/docs/cloud-amazon-ec2.md">Amazon EC2 cloud setup</a> instructions. I also configured Open VPN in AWS using
        the <a href=" https://openvpn.net/vpn-server-resources/amazon-web-services-ec2-byol-appliance-quick-start-guide/">Open VPN for Amazon Web Services EC2 </a> instructions guide. In both VPNs I had to launch 
        new instances, set up the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), allocate new addresses and associate them, and finally test the VPNs. For Algo VPN I used Wireguard to enable my VPN clients and for Open VPN I used
        OpenVPN Connect.

     <details><summary>SAS Enterprise Miner</summary>
       <br>
        For my Foundations of Analytics course, I learned to efficiently utilize the SAS Enterprise Miner software which is an advanced analytics
        data mining tool intended to help users quickly develop descriptive and predictive models through a streamlined data mining process. My course 
        assignments provided me the essential understanding and the right skills to reveal valuable insights with this powerful data mining tool. For my final 
        project I had the opportunity to apply the knowledge I obtained throughout the semester to a more applied real-life problem where my group and I had to 
        understand data, use descriptive analytics (visualization, data summary), prepare and clean the data using Excel (data preparations and transformation)
        , and finally create and compare three different prescriptive models in SAS EM. Creating different models with SAS EM analytics strengths allowed me to 
        have a better skillset for pattern discovery and predictive modeling. 
       <br>
       <br>
       <h4>Analytic Workflow Learned:</h4>
       <ul>
       <li>Define analytic objective</li>
       <li>Select cases</li>
       <li>Extract input data</li>
       <li>Validate input data</li>
       <li>Repair input data</li>
       <li>Transform input data</li> 
       <li>Apply analysis</li> 
       <li>Generate deployment methods</li> 
       <li>Integrate deployment</li> 
       <li>Gather results</li> 
       <li>Assess observed results</li> 
       <li>Refine analytic objective</li>
